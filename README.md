# gwd-scoresheet

A scoresheet for playing Geeks Who Drink-style pub quiz.

Deployed to <https://nameless-stream-40581.herokuapp.com/>

As of October 23, 2020, this repository and the deployment have been updated to GWD's new seven-round format.

This project has also been refactored [using Typescript](https://github.com/TomGower/gwd-typescript) and separately [using Recoil](https://github.com/TomGower/gwd-recoil).

Both of those refactorings were done using the old eight-round format.
